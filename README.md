The Regression Model Visualizer is a technical project designed to enable the creation of various types of models like 
simple linear, polynomial, logistic (for classification), and multi-featured models. The unique aspect of this project 
is that it doesn't rely on external machine learning libraries; instead, all functionalities are implemented from scratch. 
Once you create a model, you can observe its training performance and effectiveness in real-time through graphical 
representations. The project offers control over factors like learning rate, regularization coefficient, and other 
variables that influence the model's behavior and efficiency.
